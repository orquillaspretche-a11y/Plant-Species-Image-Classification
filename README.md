# Plant-Species-Image-Classification

A. Project Overview

**Brief description of the project:**

This project focuses on developing an image classification model that can identify different varieties of lettuce using Teachable Machine. The system is trained using images of various lettuce types, allowing it to recognize and classify them automatically based on their visual features. The goal of the project is to apply basic machine learning concepts to accurately distinguish between lettuce varieties through image recognition. The model is trained by uploading labeled images into Teachable Machine, which then generates a trained classification model.

**Purpose of the image classification model:**

The purpose of this project is to develop an image classification model that can accurately identify different lettuce varieties using machine learning. By training the model with labeled images, the system can automatically recognize and classify lettuce based on visual characteristics such as leaf shape, texture, and color.
